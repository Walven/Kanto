## Kanto React

Implementation of Kanto in React.

## Commands

When opening this folder you can use the following commands:

- `npm run storybook`: Open the storybook for Kanto React
- `npm run build`: Build the Kanto React package

## Notice

1. Kanto React uses OakSans which is loaded through submodule. Don't forget to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the fonts.
2. The fonts are not exported in the library. It's up to you to ensure your app is loading OakSans properly.
3. Kanto uses CSS without styling library to make it easier for anyone to contribute.
